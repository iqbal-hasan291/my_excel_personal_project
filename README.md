# ðŸ§¾ Personal Financial Tracker Dashboard (Janâ€“Oct 2025)

## Overview  
The **Personal Financial Tracker Dashboard** is an Excel-based project designed to monitor income, expenses, and net savings across ten months (Januaryâ€“October 2025).  
Although the dataset is **fictional**, it simulates real-world financial behavior â€” helping individuals understand where their money goes, identify spending patterns, and plan smarter savings strategies.

## Problem Statement  
Many people struggle to track their money efficiently. Bank and mobile transactions often pile up, making it difficult to know:  
- Where is the money going every month?  
- Which areas consume the most budget?  
- How much am I really saving?

This project solves that problem by building a **data-driven financial tracker** that consolidates all transactions, categorizes them, and visualizes spending habits for better decision-making.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Structured data tables for consistency and accuracy.  
- Applied Excel formulas for validation and categorization.  

### 3. Data Analysis  
- Built **Pivot Tables** to calculate monthly totals for income, expenses, and savings.  
- Used formulas like `SUMIFS`, `INDEX-MATCH`, 'xlookup', 'Vlookup' and conditional formatting for automation.  

### 4. Dashboard Development  
- Designed an **interactive Excel dashboard** with slicers for months and categories.

  - Income by category  
  - Expense distribution by percentage  
  - Month-wise net savings trend
