# 1. Personal Financial Tracker Dashboard (Jan–Oct 2025)

## Overview  
The **Personal Financial Tracker Dashboard** is an Excel-based project designed to monitor income, expenses, and net savings across ten months (January–October 2025).  
Although the dataset is **fictional**, it simulates real-world financial behavior — helping individuals understand where their money goes, identify spending patterns, and plan smarter savings strategies.

## Problem Statement  
Many people struggle to track their money efficiently. Bank and mobile transactions often pile up, making it difficult to know:  
- Where is the money going every month?  
- Which areas consume the most budget?  
- How much am I really saving?

This project solves that problem by building a **data-driven financial tracker** that consolidates all transactions, categorizes them, and visualizes spending habits for better decision-making.


## Workflow  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Gathered fictional transaction data from **DBBL, bKash, and Nagad**.  
- Included fields such as *Date, Description, Subcategory, Debit, Credit, Category,* and *Income/Expense Type.*  

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Structured data tables for consistency and accuracy.  
- Applied Excel formulas for validation and categorization.  

### 3. Data Analysis  
- Built **Pivot Tables** to calculate monthly totals for income, expenses, and savings.  
- Used formulas like `SUMIFS`, `INDEX-MATCH`, 'xlookup', 'Vlookup' and conditional formatting for automation.  

### 4. Dashboard Development  
- Designed an **interactive Excel dashboard** with slicers for months and categories.  
- Added visual components to display:  
  - Income by category  
  - Expense distribution by percentage  
  - Month-wise net savings trend

# 2. E-commerce Risk Assessment Tracker

##  Overview  
This project focuses on identifying and analyzing potential business risks in an e-commerce environment.  
The **Risk Assessment Tracker** is designed in Excel to help decision-makers visualize and mitigate high-risk areas before they cause major disruptions.  

##  Problem Statement  
E-commerce companies face multiple operational, financial, and technological risks that can affect performance and customer trust.  
The challenge was to develop a tool that not only identifies these risks but also quantifies their impact and likelihood for better management decisions.  

##  Workflow  
1. Created a structured dataset with risk name, description, responsible manager, probability, and impact.  
2. Designed **Impact** and **Probability** tables to classify each risk based on text-level criteria.  
3. Used **INDEX-MATCH** formulas to calculate the overall **Risk Level** automatically.  
4. Built an interactive **Risk Assessment Chart** to visually highlight which managers are in high or low-risk zones.

This tracker solves that by **centralizing task data** and **automatically flagging overdue tasks**.


##  Tools & Technology
- **Microsoft Excel** (main tool)  
- Functions: `IF()`, `TODAY()`, `AND()`, `OR()`, `COUNTIF()`  
- **Conditional Formatting** for overdue task highlighting
